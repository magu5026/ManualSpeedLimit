# ManualSpeedLimit
Mod for Factorio

Especially on cards with many trains, it can happen that you collide with a waiting train and destroy it, while driving manually. With this mod you can set a maximum speed for trains in manual mode. At any time you can adjust the speed limit in the mod settings or disable the mod. The default value is 20 km/h.
